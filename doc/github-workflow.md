# GitHub workflow guidelines

## Project Boards
- One JValue-Scope Project board
- One for each repository, linked to issues
- One project board for each student project in the corresponding repo, possibly linked to issues 
  
## Issues
- One issue board for each repository
- Issues should be tagged appropriately to enable external contributions

## External Contributions
- External contributions are to be encouraged
- External contributors may stage issues or work on existing ones
- Self staged issues may be discussed with the admin team to ensure later integration
- For integration into ods codebase they need to sign a contributers agreement (via the CLA Assistant GitHub Plugin)
- Code integration and review is to be done by pull requests. The pull requests have to be approved by at least one member of the repositories admins team. 

## Repositories
- Master branch is protected: No direct push, only via reviewed pull request from separate branches
- If possible, pull requests should be linked to issues
- Students work on their own forks using regular pull requests to get fast feedback

## Branch Naming Scheme
- *linked issue #*-*ods-subproject*-*short branch description*
- example: 39-documentation-githubguidleines

## Teams
- For each repository, there is an admins and a developers team
- The admins team consists of people permanently working on the ods, like employees
- The developers team consists of people temporarily working on the ods, like students
- Further teams (or subteams) may be added as needed
  
The document itself is open for discussion and modification via appropriate pull requests.
