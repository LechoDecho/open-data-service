## Getting Started

* Build with `./gradlew build`
* Run unit tests with `./gradlew test`
* Run integration test with `./gradlew integrationTest` (note that a instance of the coreService needs to be up).
* Start with `./gradlew bootRun`  - <b>not recommended</b>
* Use Docker-Compose: `docker-compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up` builds Docker images and starts them up. 
Note that you need to delete existing docker images from your local docker daemon to have recent changes integrated.
